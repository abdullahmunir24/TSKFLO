# Frontend Test Results

This directory contains test results and coverage reports for the frontend application.

## Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated with Vitest and stored in the `coverage` directory. To generate coverage reports, run:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Current Test Coverage

As of the last run, here's the coverage report for the components we've tested:

| File | % Statements | % Branch | % Functions | % Lines |
|------|--------------|----------|------------|---------|
| src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| src/services/socketService.js | 92.85% | 100% | 100% | 92.85% |
| src/utils/auth.js | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |

## Test Cases

We currently have tests for the following components:

### Components
- `ProtectedRoute.jsx`: Tests for authentication state handling, redirecting unauthenticated users, and displaying protected content to authenticated users.

### Services
- `socketService.js`: Tests for socket connection management, including initialization, reconnection, and disconnection.

### Utilities
- `auth.js`: Tests for token decoding functionality, including handling valid and invalid tokens.

## Expanding Test Coverage

To improve test coverage, additional tests should be added for:

1. More UI components (navigation bars, modals, forms)
2. Redux reducers and actions
3. API service functions
4. Context providers
5. Custom hooks

## Continuous Integration

In a CI/CD pipeline, these tests should be run automatically on each pull request to ensure code quality is maintained.
