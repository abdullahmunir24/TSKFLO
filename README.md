## Overview

A comprehensive task management system designed for team collaboration, with role-based access control, task tracking, and real-time communication features. The system provides a secure and efficient way for teams to organize, assign, and monitor tasks.

## Features

### User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (100% Complete)

- Secure login and logout functionality with JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control with admin and user roles
- Admin user management (create, update, delete users)
- Admin ability to lock tasks to prevent further changes

### Task Management (100% Complete)

- Comprehensive task creation and management
- Tasks include title, description, priority, due date, status, and assignee(s)
- Multiple assignees per task
- Task search functionality with multiple criteria
- Task notifications for team members

### Team Communication (100% Complete)

- Live messaging functionality for team collaboration
- Real-time notifications for task assignments and updates

### Admin Dashboard (100% Complete)

- Metrics and analytics for task progress tracking
- User management interface
- System-wide task monitoring

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Socket.io for real-time features
- Winston for logging
- Jest for testing

### Frontend

- React.js with React Router
- Redux for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for API requests
- Socket.io-client for real-time features
- React Chartjs-2 for dashboard visualizations

## Implementation Patterns

### Design Patterns

1. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented in the notification system and socket connections to provide real-time updates.
2. **Factory Pattern**: Used for standardized object creation in tasks, users, and API requests.

### Architectural Pattern

- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between presentation (frontend), business logic (controllers), and data access (models) layers.
